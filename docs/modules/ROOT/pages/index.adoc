= Neovim Plugin

The Neovim plugin provides language support for authoring Pkl files in neovim.

Follow the xref:installation.adoc[installation instructions] and check out the xref:features/index.adoc[feature overview].

NOTE: Standard vim is not supported because it does not support syntax highlighting via tree-sitter.
